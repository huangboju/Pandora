# interactive-animations

This project is an example of using `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to create interactive animations.
This was originally created as a demo to accompany a talk I gave at an Austin iOS developer meetup in September, 2017.

## About

The repository's commits are structured to show the various phases of building the animation.
In the original talk, I would jump between commits to gradually introduce concepts.

I wrote a tutorial blog post on how to implement this animation step-by-step. It's available here: [Building Better iOS App Animations](http://www.swiftkickmobile.com/building-better-app-animations-swift-uiviewpropertyanimator/)

The animation is inspired by a WWDC 2017 presentation titled "Advanced Animations with UIKit".
