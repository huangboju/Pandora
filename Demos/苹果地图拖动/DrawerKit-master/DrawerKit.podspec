  s.description   = <<-DESC
DrawerKit allows you to modally present a view controller from another, in such a way that the
presented view controller slides up as a "drawer", much like what happens when you tap on a location
in the map when using the Apple Maps app. The library is highly configurable, with more options
being added regularly.
