# Features
- Multiple *sticky* points
- Landscape support
- Scroll views friendly

# Setup
1. Add `pod 'PullUpController'` to your Podfile or copy `PullUpController.swift` into your project
2. Make sure the view controller that will be your pull up controller inherits from `PullUpController`
3. Add the controller as child of your main controller using `addPullUpController(<#T##PullUpController#>)`
 
# Customization
You can customize the controller behavior by overriding the followings properties:

`pullUpControllerPreviewOffset: CGFloat`
>The desired height in screen units expressed in the pull up controller coordinate system that will be initially showed.
>The default value is ```50```

`pullUpControllerPreferredSize: CGSize`
>The desired size of the pull up controller’s view, in screen units.
>The default value is width: `UIScreen.main.bounds.width, height: 400`.

`pullUpControllerMiddleStickyPoints: [CGFloat]`
>A list of y values, in screen units expressed in the pull up controller coordinate system.
>At the end of the gestures the pull up controller will scroll to the nearest point in the list.
>     
>Please keep in mind that this array should contains only sticky points in the middle of the pull up controller's view;
>There is therefore no need to add the fist one (`pullUpControllerPreviewOffset`), and/or the last one (`pullUpControllerPreferredSize.height`).
>    
>For a complete list of all the sticky points you can use `pullUpControllerAllStickyPoints`

`pullUpControllerAllStickyPoints: [CGFloat]`
>A list of y values, in screen units expressed in the pull up controller coordinate system.
>At the end of the gesture the pull up controller will scroll at the nearest point in the list.

`pullUpControllerIsBouncingEnabled: Bool`
>A Boolean value that determines whether bouncing occurs when scrolling reaches the end of the pull up controller's view size.
>The default value is `false`.

`pullUpControllerPreferredLandscapeFrame: CGRect`
>The desired size of the pull up controller’s view, in screen units when the device is in landscape mode.
>The default value is `(x: 10, y: 10, width: 300, height: UIScreen.main.bounds.height - 20)`.

It's possible to change the view controller's view position by using the method
`pullUpControllerMoveToVisiblePoint(_ visiblePoint: CGFloat, completion: (() -> Void)?)`

>This method will move the pull up controller's view in order to show the provided visible point.
>    
>You may use on of `pullUpControllerAllStickyPoints` item to provide a valid visible point.
>- `visiblePoint`: the y value to make visible, in screen units expressed in the pull up controller coordinate system.
>- `completion`: The closure to execute after the animation is completed. This block has no return value and takes no parameters. You may specify nil for this parameter.

PullUpController is easy draggable even if your `PullUpController`'s view contains a `UIScrollView`, just attach it to the controller itself with the following method:
`<#T##UIScrollView#>.attach(to: <#T##PullUpController#>)`
>Attach the scroll view to the provided pull up controller in order to move it with the scroll view content.
>- `pullUpController`: the pull up controller to move with the current scroll view content.
