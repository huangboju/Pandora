## Changelog

## 2.0.0 Release notes (8/12/2017)
----

DeckTransition is now at version 2.0! üéâ

This is a major API upgrade. The previous API which required `UIScrollViewDelegate` conformance has been entirely removed, and is replaced by an automatic `UIScrollView` detection mechanism.

### API Breaking Changes
- The `isDismissEnabled` property on `DeckTransitioningDelegate` is removed. This behaviour is now managed automatically, which means that your old dismissal code is no longer needed and can be removed entirely, and your existing view controllers should "just work" in most cases.

  There exist some edge cases with the new mechanism, more about which, including workarounds, can be found in the documentation ºs new [UIScrollView detection guide](https://harshilshah.github.io/DeckTransition/uiscrollview-detection.html).

### Other Changes
- A new `isSwipeToDismissEnabled` parameter is added to the `DeckTransitioningDelegate` initializer, to disable the swipe-to-dismiss gesture entirely, if need be. This is set to `true` by default and requires no change to retain previous behaviour.

1.0.0 Release notes (5/8/2017)
----

DeckTransition is finally at 1.0! üéâ Here‚Äôs a summary of all the changes in this version

- Vastly improved performance
- Reorganized project structure
- Support for Carthage
- All ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù have been refactored out

One small change needs to be implemented in pre-1.0 projects to maintain compatibility with this version of DeckTransition. The entirety of the change consists of replacing the following line of code in your modal view controller‚Äôs `UIScrollViewDelegate` implementation

```swift
scrollView.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: scrollView.contentOffset.y)
```

with the block that follows below:

```swift
scrollView.subviews.forEach {
    $0.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: scrollView.contentOffset.y)
}
```

The implementation example in the ReadMe has been updated to reflect this.
