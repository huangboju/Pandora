# CustomViewTransitionDemo
A simple demo for custom view controller transition

iOS 7 introduced custom view controller transitions which make it possible for developers 
to create their own animated transitions from one view controller to the next in their apps. 
In this demo, we'll take a look at how to do this. We'll also look at how to create gesture 
driven transitions called interactive transitions. To follow along, you can download the sample
code and refer to the tutorial below:
