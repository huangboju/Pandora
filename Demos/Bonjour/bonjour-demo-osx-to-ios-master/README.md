# Communication between iOS & OS X with Bonjour

This repository has two XCode projects

* An OS X Bonjour server that can send/recieve data
* An iOS Bonjour client that can send/recieve data

You'll need Xcode 8.2 or greater

PS... I wrote this as proof of concept & to learn Swift years ago. If you're going to use it in production, use it as a reference and rewrite it yourself!
