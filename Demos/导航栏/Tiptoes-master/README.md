# Description üçÉ
Forget about the appearance of system's own navigation component, create a new one that you really care for. **Tiptoes** is a subclass of UINavigationController that will make the navigating process more silent and delicate. 

# Customization 
You can do lots of customization yourself.
For example:

- Transition effect. The default effect of Tiptoes is fade-in-and-out. And since we can get the animation parameters, we can create more lovely one.

Fade-in-and-out:

- Everything that related to a UIView. 

# Usage
1. Drag the TiptoesNavController.swift to your project.
2. In the place of your setting navigationController's rootViewController code(normally in AppDelegate.swift), replace ```UINavigationController(rootViewController:xxx)```with```TiptoesNavController(rootViewController:xxx)```
3. Enjoy!

# Demo

[@CaiYue\_](http://weibo.com/caiyue233) made this with ‚ù§Ô∏è. Inspired by Unread APP.

# Contribute
As you can see, Tiptoes provide a thinking to customize navigation bar. But it is not perfect due to the limitation of author's time and energy. So I open up this repo to GitHub and I am looking forward that you guys can join me and make this repository more splendid.
