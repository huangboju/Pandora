# Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble using Tabman, please check out this document to see if you can resolve any problems that you're having. If not please raise an [issue](https://github.com/uias/Tabman/issues/new).

## Automatic Insetting
Tabman is designed to automatically inset the contents of child view controllers that contain `UIScrollView` and other derived classes so that it shows correctly beneath the bar: 

<p align="center">
    </br>
    <img src="Resources/autoinsetting.png" width="375" alt="Auto Insetting"/>
    </br>
</p>

If you are having issues with Automatic Insetting, please try the following steps...

### 1) Ensure it's turned on
Make sure that auto insetting is enabled (it is by default).
```swift
.automaticallyAdjustsChildScrollViewInsets = true
```

### 2) Check your constraints
If you are using a custom view controller (and not something like a `UITableViewController`), the way that your content scroll view is constrained to the superview is very important. 

The auto insetting engine in Tabman calculates and applies all insets relative to the superview, rather than any layout guides. Therefore you need to ensure that your `UIScrollView` is constrained directly to the superview, as shown below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="Resources/autoinsetting_constraints.png" width="890" alt="Auto Insetting"/>
</p>

As you can see, the constraints for the `UITableView` are pinned to the superview rather than the `topLayoutGuide` or `Safe Area`.

    <img src="Resources/autoinsetting_constraints_detail.png" width="262" alt="Auto Insetting Constraints"/>
</p>

### 3) Watch out for UIKit
Tabman will also handle any `UIKit` properties that require modifying in order to get a reliable insetting behaviour. As we're providing a completely custom implementation, we disable a lot of the `UIKit` helper properties that would otherwise inset content correctly for system components such as a `UITabBar`. 

Therefore, you shouldn't need to modify or have any of the following in your view controller code:
```swift
UIScrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior
UIViewController.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets
```

Modifying these properties will more than likely cause issues with the auto insetting engine, so it is advised to remove any usages from your code.

### 4) Everything *should* be okay
By this point, you should have a beautifully insetted table view in your child view controller, otherwise ðŸ˜­.

**Next steps:**
1. It might be useful to use the numbers provided by `bar.requiredInsets` to manually inset your content. Depending on how successful this is will help with debugging.
2. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/uias/Tabman/issues/new), and provide as much detail as you can about your layout and just what is going wrong.
3. We'll get on with fixing it as soon as possible ðŸ¤ž.
