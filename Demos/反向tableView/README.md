# ReverseExtensionDemo

iOS tableview is one of the most important user interface components on iOS and almost every iOS app uses it. For example, your contacts are displayed in a iOS tableview. Another example is the Mail app.
However, most of these apps add cells from the top to bottom, but today we’ll see [how to create an iOS tableview that add cells from the bottom up](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-ios-tableview-swift-component/).

For this, we’re going to use Reverse Extension – a Swift component that enhances the UITableView and allows you to add cells from the bottom up as we see in the chat apps.
